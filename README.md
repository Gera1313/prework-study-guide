# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## A study guide for course pre-work.

A short description explaining the what, why, and how of the project.

- Created in order to help me study and stay focused. 
- This project was built in order to help me make notes and keep them in a safe and easily accessible area. 
- A problem that it solves is the fact the notes are in the web where they cannot be destroyed as opposed to having the notes in a laptop, mobile device, or paper notebook.
- I have learned about the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.
